# mlcast

This repo so far contains a few scripts which are used to

1. demonstrate how `pysteps` vs `pytorch-lightning` handle representing scalar fields and model instantiation (see [pysteps_ref.py](pysteps_ref.py) and [pl_ref.py](pl_ref.py)), and
2. outline how the API for the `mlcast` package might look (see [mlcast_api.py](mlcast_api.py)).

Please feel free to raise issues or PRs if you have any suggestions or questions.
