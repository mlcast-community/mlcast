    """
        precip: array-like
        Array of shape (ar_order+1,m,n) containing the input precipitation fields
        ordered by timestamp from oldest to newest. The time steps between
        the inputs are assumed to be regular.
    velocity: array-like
        Array of shape (2,m,n) containing the x- and y-components of the
        advection field.
        The velocities are assumed to represent one time step between the
        inputs. All values are required to be finite.
    timesteps: int or list of floats
        Number of time steps to forecast or a list of time steps for which the
        forecasts are computed (relative to the input time step). The elements
        of the list are required to be in ascending order.

    Returns
    -------
    out: ndarray
        A three-dimensional array of shape (num_timesteps,m,n) containing a time
        series of forecast precipitation fields. The time series starts from
        t0+timestep, where timestep is taken from the input precipitation fields
        precip. If measure_time is True, the return value is a three-element
        tuple containing the nowcast array, the initialization time of the
        nowcast generator and the time used in the main loop (seconds).
